We use Docker Compose to launch this application. Here is how to do it:

```

See in the docker-compose.yml file for which ports it listens on.

### Database migrations

We use Flyway to manage the different SQL scripts for each change to the database schema.
Docker Compose should run flyway scripts automatically. Simply add scripts under flyway/sql/
and make sure to follow the numbering system of flyway.
